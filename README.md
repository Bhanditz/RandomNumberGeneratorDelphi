RandomNumberGeneratorDelphi (November, 2005; I was about 14 years old)
===========================

Simple program written in delphi: random number generator. By default, it randomizes numbers from 1 to 6 (standard dice), but user can set the range on his own. What is more, using this program you can cheat: by typing apropriate keys combination random number can be magically high or low ;).
